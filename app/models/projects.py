"""Projects models module.

This module provides functions for managing projects in the database, including
fetching a paginated list of projects with associated issues, adding a new project,
deleting a project, and updating a projectâ€™s name. Each function is decorated to ensure
the correct database connection context for reading or writing.

Functions:
    fetch_projects: Retrieves a paginated list of projects with issue counts.
    add_project: Adds a new project with a unique project ID.
    delete_project_by_id: Deletes a project by its unique project ID.
    update_project_name: Updates the name of a project by its unique project ID.
